* **Description**: Creation of K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers and evaluation of their performance based on the variation of parameters such as the percentage of data for training and testing, the number of nearest neighbors (k), among others.

* **Data**: Random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

* **Topics**:
  - `K-nearest neighbor classifier`
  - `Machine learning`
  - `Data distribution`
  - `Visualization of predictions`

* **Description**: Evaluation of hyperparameters and their combination for a k-nearest neighbors (knn) classifier. Functions such as GridSearchCV are implemented to obtain the results of each combination and K-Fold cross-validation to find the influence of the data on the model.

* **Data**: Random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

* **Topics**:
  - `Hyperparameters analysis`
  - `K-Fold validation`
  - `K-nearest neighbor classifier`
  - `Machine learning`

* **Description**: Development of a k-nearest neighbors (knn) classifier to predict whether a given song will be liked or not.

* **Data**: More than 2000 Spotify songs from a specific user marked as liked or disliked.

* **Topics**:
  - `Hyperparameters analysis`
  - `K-Fold validation`
  - `Data analysis`
  - `Feature selection`
  - `K-nearest neighbor classifier`
  - `Machine learning`
