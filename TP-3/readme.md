# TP-3: NON-parametric classifiers: K-nearest neighbors (KNN)

## [*3-1_KNN_Overview.ipynb*](https://github.com/Alejandro-ZZ/Machine-Learning-UNS/blob/master/TP-3/3_1_KNN_Overview.ipynb)
Creation of K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers and evaluation of their behavior based on the variation of parameters such as the percentage of data for training and testing, the number of nearest neighbors (k), among others.

## [*3_2_KNN_GridSearch.ipynb*](https://github.com/Alejandro-ZZ/Machine-Learning-UNS/blob/master/TP-3/3_2_KNN_GridSearch.ipynb)
Evaluation of hyperparameters and their combination for a k-nearest neighbors (knn) classifier. Functions such as GridSearchCV are implemented to obtain the results of each combination and K-Fold cross-validation to find the influence of the data on the model.

## [*3_3_Spotify_songs.ipynb*](https://github.com/Alejandro-ZZ/Machine-Learning-UNS/blob/master/TP-3/3_3_Spotify_songs.ipynb)
Development of a k-nearest neighbors (knn) classifier to predict whether a given song will be liked or not. A dataset with more than 2000 Spotify songs of a user is implemented, where some were marked as liked and others were not.
