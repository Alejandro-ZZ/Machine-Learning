# TP-2: Exploratory analysis and parametric classifiers

## [*2-1_Exploratory_analysis.ipynb*](https://github.com/Alejandro-ZZ/Machine-Learning-UNS/blob/master/TP-2/2_1_Exploratory_analysis.ipynb)
General exploratory analysis to find data showing abnormal behavior. The data is related to the sanitary and epidemiological situation of the municipality of Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina.

## [*2-2_Least_error_classifier.ipynb*](https://github.com/Alejandro-ZZ/Machine-Learning-UNS/blob/master/TP-2/2_2_Least_error_classifier.ipynb)
Design of a minimum error classifier based on the ROC curve from *"randomly"* generated data with Gaussian distribution. An analysis is performed on the quality parameters of the classifier by changing aspects of the generated data such as its mean and standard deviation.
